User Interface:

1. Use a clean and modern design: The user interface should be visually appealing and easy on the eyes. Use a modern design language that is consistent throughout the app.

2. Use icons and graphics to aid navigation: Icons and graphics can help users quickly identify different sections of the app and navigate to the features they need.

3. Use color to highlight important elements: Use color to draw attention to important elements, such as buttons or error messages.

4. Provide clear and concise instructions: The app should provide clear and concise instructions on how to use its features. Use simple language and avoid technical jargon.

5. Use tooltips and pop-ups to provide additional information: Tooltips and pop-ups can provide additional information to users without cluttering the main interface.

Overall Architecture:

1. Use a microservices architecture: A microservices architecture can help make the app more scalable and easier to maintain. Each microservice should be responsible for a specific task, such as code analysis or error checking.

2. Use a cloud-based infrastructure: A cloud-based infrastructure can provide the app with the scalability and flexibility it needs to handle large numbers of users.

3. Use machine learning to improve the app: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze user behavior and improve the app's suggestions and feedback over time.

4. Use a modular architecture: The app should be designed in a modular way, with each module responsible for a specific task. This will make it easier to maintain and update the app in the future.

5. Use version control: Version control can help ensure that the app is always up-to-date and that changes are tracked and documented.
